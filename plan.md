Project Brief: Binary Jazz Portfolio (Flutter)

Overview

Develop a high-performance portfolio application using Flutter. The application serves as a digital stage to showcase a collection of web-based projects, reflecting my identity as a .NET Fullstack Web Developer who thrives on experimentation.

Professional Persona

The Binary Jazz Engineer

Definition: Improvised logic, structured chaos, and high-performance execution. This title should be a central design element within the UI.

Core Skills: .NET Ecosystem, Fullstack Web Development, UI/UX Experimentation.

Technical Requirements

Command: Initialize with flutter create . in the root directory.

Target: Web-first responsive design.

Theme Service: A centralized service managing four distinct visual identities, all adhering to WCAG accessibility standards for contrast and legibility.

User Experience Goal

The app should be more than a list of links—it should be an "experiment" in itself. Transitions between themes should be fluid, and the "Binary Jazz" philosophy should be felt through micro-interactions and creative layouts.
